# Linux-Magics

Linux has many weird, unexpected and funny tricks & behaviors that make you say WTF.

Let's investigate them and learn about how Linux works under the hood.

## 0x01 - Execute ELF without executable permissions

Create new copy of `id` binary without executable permissions

Great - not working

Let's take the first string of the binary and use it to execute it

WTF

What is that string?

We invoked the dynamic loader with the ELF file as an argument

The dynamic loader is responsible for starting dynamically linked programs - loads the ELF binary into memory, resolves and links shared libraries and transfers control to the programâ€™s main() function

Dynamic loader path located in ELF header - PT_INTERP (Program Header)

But how is the dynamic loader invoked normally?

binfmt_elf - the kernel checks binary magic bytes (`\x7fELF`), parses the program headers to extract PT_INTERP and executes the interpreter (aka dynamic loader) instead of the binary directly, passing the ELF file as its first argument
